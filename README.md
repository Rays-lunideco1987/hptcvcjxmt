Just walked out of the theater after seeing this wild 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, Pabrik Gula, and I mean... what did I just sit through? First impression – sugar ain’t sweet, it's a sticky mess of chaos. Seriously, at some point midway, I found myself wondering if the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers were just making a giant statement about how life’s curveballs can knock the wind out of you with sticky precision. And the characters! I felt like I got shoved into their sugar-coated frenzy; their voices still echoing in my skull like a crazy jukebox stuck on repeat – not always a good kind of repeat, by the way.

The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 opens with this intense scene that had everyone swallowing their popcorn a little too loudly. I could’ve sworn I caught the guy next to me murmuring, “Well, that escalated quickly.” And hey, didn’t it just? The visuals were kind of like reading a magazine in a dream – flipping through random chaos you sort of understand but also you don't. Some parts felt like a fever dream Minnie Mouse would have on her day off. You know exactly the ones I'm talking about when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ... if you dare 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   on some sleepless night.

And speaking of visuals, let's talk about the way they painted those factory scenes – dripping with nostalgia and despair. Romantic yet hostile, I guess? It was like standing in the middle of an old family photo that's falling apart at the edges. The director could’ve toned down a bit on the kaleidoscopic grief over brown sugar’s demise, I swear my eyes need a holiday now.

Here's the kicker – halfway through, I was torn between giving up on understanding the plot and surrendering to the kaleidoscope. My brain juggled three questions: What time is it? Is it supposed to be this weird? And why do I suddenly crave pancakes?

But despite all my sarcasm and eye rolls, I think there's a bittersweet aftertaste to Pabrik Gula that sticks. The smell of something burned lingering in the back of your mind, thoughts about loss, frustration, and life’s gooey unpredictability. It’s utterly imperfect yet shamelessly captivating – kinda like a cotton candy cloud that refuses to float out of your headspace.

Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again? Ask me after I finish this mind-bending existential sugar rush nap.
